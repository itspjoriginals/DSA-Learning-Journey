## Problem Statement

Given an array, `arr[]` of `n` integers, and an integer element `x`, find whether element `x` is present in the array. Return the index of the **first occurrence** of `x` in the array, or `-1` if it doesn't exist.

---

## Examples

**Input:**  
`arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `x = 3`  
**Output:**  
`2`  
**Explanation:**  
For array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the element to be searched is `3`. Since `3` is present at index `2`, the output is `2`.

---

**Input:**  
`arr[] = [10, 8, 30, 4, 5]`, `x = 5`  
**Output:**  
`4`  
**Explanation:**  
For array `[10, 8, 30, 4, 5]`, the element to be searched is `5` and it is at index `4`. So, the output is `4`.

---

**Input:**  
`arr[] = [10, 8, 30]`, `x = 6`  
**Output:**  
`-1`  
**Explanation:**  
The element to be searched is `6` and it is not present, so we return `-1`.

---

## Constraints

- \(1 \leq \text{arr.size} \leq 10^6\)  
- \(0 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq 10^6\)  
- \(0 \leq x \leq 10^5\)

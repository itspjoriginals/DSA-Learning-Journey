# DSA Learning Journey 🚀

This repository documents my day-by-day learning journey through Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) as I prepare for coding interviews. It serves as a personal tracker, a revision guide, and a resource for anyone looking to follow a structured DSA preparation plan.

## 📘 About
The goal of this repository is to strengthen my problem-solving skills and build a strong grasp of key algorithms and data structures through consistent daily practice. Each folder represents a day’s work, containing problems, solutions, and notes.
